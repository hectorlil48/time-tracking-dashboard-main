### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN is always useful. I was able to get a refresher of the display grid. I learned how to set up my columns and rows.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Google is helpful in many ways. I usually ask Google how to do something and it returns many links to help me. It also has a good AI feature that returns good answers.
